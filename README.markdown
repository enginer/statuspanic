What is StatusPanic?
====================
StatusPanic is a simple Grails application clone of the 
[Panic](http://panic.com)-style [Status Board](http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/) 

This code was ported to grails directly from the work of [Allyn Bauer](https://github.com/ajb/statuspanic)

Demo
====
Here is a [working sample](http://grailsdev1.appspot.com/) running on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/)


Configuration
====================
Most of the data is configured in the web-app/config.json file. Some data is still embeded directly in the controllers, however this will change soon.


Tasks Outstanding
=================
Implement a simple scaffolded admin for the data.
